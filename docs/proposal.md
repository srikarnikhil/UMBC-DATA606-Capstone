# Object Detection Web Application with YOLOv8 and Streamlit

## Introduction
In this proposal, we outline our plan to develop an object detection web application using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit. The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web interface that leverages state-of-the-art object detection techniques to identify and classify objects in videos.

## Project Description
Object detection models play a crucial role in various applications, from surveillance systems to autonomous vehicles. For this project, we will focus on utilizing YOLOv8, a highly efficient and accurate object detection model, to develop a web application capable of real-time object detection in images and videos.

### Technologies and Tools
- **YOLOv8**: You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a family of object detection models known for their speed and accuracy. YOLOv8, the latest version, will serve as the backbone for our object detection system.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision library, OpenCV, will be used for image and video processing tasks, including object detection, image manipulation, and video I/O operations.
- **Streamlit**: Streamlit is a popular Python library for building interactive web applications. We will leverage Streamlit's intuitive API to develop a simple yet powerful web interface for our object detection system.

### Features of the Web Application
Our web application will offer the following features:
1. **Video Upload**: Users can upload a video file from their local system.
2. **Real-time Object Detection**: The application will perform real-time object detection on the uploaded video, displaying bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
3. **Custom Class Selection**: Users can choose specific object classes for detection, allowing for customization based on their requirements.
4. **File Uploader**: Streamlit's file uploader component will facilitate seamless file uploads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The web interface will be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Dataset
For training and evaluation purposes, we will utilize the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains a diverse collection of images with annotations for object detection tasks. The COCO dataset offers a wide range of object categories and provides a comprehensive benchmark for testing the performance of object detection algorithms.

### Overview of COCO Dataset
- **Number of Images**: Approximately 330,000 images.
- **Object Categories**: The dataset includes annotations for 80 object categories, covering a broad spectrum of common everyday objects such as person, car, bicycle, and more.
- **Annotation Format**: Annotations in the COCO dataset include bounding boxes for objects, enabling precise localization and classification during training and evaluation.
- **Diversity and Complexity**: The COCO dataset captures objects in various contexts and settings, including indoor and outdoor scenes, making it suitable for training robust object detection models capable of handling diverse real-world scenarios.
- **Usage in Research and Benchmarking**: Due to its size, diversity, and high-quality annotations, the COCO dataset is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of object detection algorithms. Many state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated on the COCO dataset, making it an essential resource for the computer vision community.

### Importance of Dataset Selection
The choice of dataset plays a crucial role in the success of object detection projects. By selecting the COCO dataset, we ensure access to a rich and well-curated collection of images and annotations, facilitating the training and evaluation of our object detection model. Additionally, leveraging a widely recognized benchmark dataset like COCO enhances the credibility and reproducibility of our research findings, enabling comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods and fostering collaboration within the research community.

## Proposed Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Download the COCO dataset and save it to the "data" subfolder.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the COCO dataset using a Jupyter Notebook stored in the "notebooks" folder. Analyze the distribution of object categories, examine sample images, and gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
3. **Model Development**: Train the YOLOv8 model on the COCO dataset to build an accurate object detection model.
4. **Web Application Development**: Use Streamlit to develop the object detection web application, integrating the trained YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection.
5. **Testing and Deployment**: Test the web application extensively to ensure its functionality and performance. Deploy the application to a suitable platform for public access.

## Conclusion
The proposed project aims to combine advanced object detection techniques with user-friendly web development frameworks to create an intuitive and efficient object detection web application. By leveraging YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit, we aim to deliver a powerful tool that simplifies the process of object detection in videos, catering to both novice and experienced users.
